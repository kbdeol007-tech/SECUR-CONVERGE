## Project Overview

**SECUR-CONVERGE** is an end-to-end cyber-physical security portfolio project demonstrating the implementation of a converged security program for a fictional multi-site organization (**SECUR-CORP**).

The project combines Governance, Risk Management, Security Monitoring, Digital Forensics, Incident Response, and Executive Analytics into a single operational workflow.

Unlike isolated cybersecurity exercises, this project demonstrates how physical security events (badge access, CCTV, facility controls) can be correlated with digital security telemetry (system logs, authentication events, network activity) to improve organizational resilience.

This project is inspired by my professional experience supervising physical security operations and combines that background with modern cybersecurity methodologies including:

- Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0)
- NIST SP 800-30 Risk Assessment
- Security Operations (SecOps)
- Digital Forensics
- Security Data Analytics

# About This Project

This repository was created as part of my cybersecurity portfolio to demonstrate practical experience in designing and implementing a converged cyber-physical security program.

Although the organization and incident scenario are fictional, the methodologies, workflows, technologies, and security practices reflect real-world enterprise environments and industry best practices.
